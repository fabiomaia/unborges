# unborges

Parody script, made as a private joke in 5 minutes at the library, which fixes Java source code produced by professor Ant√≥nio Borges whose IO library nobody cares about.

```
$ unborges Example.java
```

More usefully, this shall serve as my personal reference to basic `sed` usage which I still have not committed to memory.
