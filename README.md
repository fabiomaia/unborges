# unborges

Parody script, made in 5 minutes at the library in a moment of procrastination, which fixes Java source code produced by professor Ant√≥nio Borges whose IO library nobody cares about.

```
$ unborges Example.java
```

More usefully, this shall serve as my personal reference to basic `sed` usage which I shamefully still have not committed to memory.
